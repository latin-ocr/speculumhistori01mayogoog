Drumcrlox OF Tur: MASTER Ol‘ Tur: llOLLS.

On the 26th of January 1857, the Master of the Rolla
submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the publication
of materiale for the History of this Country from the
Invasion of the Romans to the Reign of Henry VIII.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materiola
should he selected for publication under competent editors
without reference to periodical or chronological arrange·
ment, without mutilation or abridgment‚ preference being
given, in the first instance, to such materiale as were mort
scarae and waluable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historical document
to be edited should be treated in the same way as if the
editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps3 and for this
purpose the most correct text should be formed from an
accurate collation of the best MSS.

To render the work more· generally useful, the M aster
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should odd to the work a brief
account of the life and times of the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology; but no other
note or comment was to be allowed, except what might bc

necessary to establish the conectness of the text.
